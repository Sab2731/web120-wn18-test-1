 <p>I used to take CS I and II Classes at Belllevue College, but I did not like too much because it's like logic type of thing; I think my brain did not work that way. However, the Wed Development seems more creativity that something I can build with. I found that really interested to me, and I really wanted to learn it well and treat it like my hobby.</p>
